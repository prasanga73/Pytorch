## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The model classifies facial images into **7 emotion classes**:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

The architecture is a custom deep CNN with 5 convolutional layers followed by batch normalization, ReLU activations, max pooling, and fully connected layers with dropout. The model achieves approximately **65% accuracy** on the FER-2013 test set.

## Architecture

- Input: Grayscale images (1 channel)
- Conv Layers: 5 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32 â†’ 512)
- Batch Normalization and ReLU after each convolution
- MaxPooling layers for downsampling
- Fully connected layers: 256 â†’ 512 â†’ 7 (output classes)
- Dropout layer to reduce overfitting
